Installation
Installation requirements
Electrical supply and grounding
• 
AC 220-240 V / 50 Hz fuse or circuit 
breaker is required
• 
Use an individual branch circuit specific 
to the washing machine
To ensure proper grounding, the washing 
machine comes with a power cord featuring 
a three-prong grounding plug for use in a 
properly installed and grounded outlet.
Check with a qualified electrician or 
serviceperson if you are not sure about the 
grounding. 
Do not modify the provided plug. If it does 
not fit the outlet, call a qualified electrician 
to install a proper outlet.
WARNING
• 
Do NOT use an extension cord.
• 
Use only the power cord that comes 
with the washing machine.
• 
Do NOT connect the ground wire to 
plastic plumbing, gas lines, or hot water 
pipes.
• 
Improperly connected grounding 
conductors may cause electric shock.
Water supply
A proper water pressure for this washing 
machine is between 50 kPa and 800 kPa. 
Water pressure less than 50 kPa may cause 
the water valve not to close completely. Or, 
it may take longer to fill the drum, causing 
the washing machine to turn off. Water taps 
must be within 120 cm from the rear of the 
washing machine so that the provided inlet 
hoses reach the washing machine.
To reduce the risk of leaks:
• 
Make sure water taps are easily 
accessible.
• 
Turn off the taps when the washing 
machine is not in use.
• 
Check for any leaks at the water inlet 
hose fittings on a regular basis.
CAUTION
Before using the washing machine for the 
first time, check all connections at the water 
valve and taps for any leaks.
Drain
Samsung recommends a standpipe in 
height of 60~90 cm. The drain hose must 
be connected through the hose clip to the 
standpipe, and the standpipe must fully 
cover the drain hose.

Installation
Installation
Flooring
For best performance, the washing 
machine must be installed on a solid floor. 
Wood floors may need to be reinforced 
to minimize vibration and/or unbalanced 
loads. Carpeting and soft tile surfaces are 
not a good resistance to vibrations and may 
cause the washing machine to move slightly 
during the spin cycle.
CAUTION
Do NOT install the washing machine on a 
platform or a poorly supported structure.
Water temperature
Do not install the washing machine in areas 
where water may freeze as the washing 
machine always retains some water in its 
water valves, pumps, and/or hoses. Frozen 
water left in the connection parts may 
cause damage to belts, the pump, and other 
components of the washing machine.
Alcove or closet installation
Minimum clearance for stable operation:
Sides
25 mm
Rear
50 mm
Top
25 mm
Front
550 mm
If both the washing machine and a dryer 
are installed in the same location, the front 
of the alcove or closet must have at least 
a 550 mm unobstructed air opening. Your 
washing machine alone does not require a 
specific air opening.

NOTE
• 
After connecting the water hose to the adaptor, check if it is connected properly by 
pulling the water hose downwards.
• 
Use a popular type of water taps. If the tap is square-shaped or too big, remove the 
spacer ring before inserting the tap into the adaptor.
For models with an additional hot water 
inlet:
1.	 Connect the red end of the hot water 
hose to the hot water inlet on the back 
of the machine.
2.	 Connect the other end of the hot water 
hose to the hot water tap.

STEP 5  Position the drain hose
The drain hose can be positioned in three ways:

A
Over the edge of a wash basin
The drain hose must be placed at a height 
of between 60 cm and 90 cm (*) from the 
floor. To keep the spout of the drain hose 
bent, use the supplied plastic hose guide (A). 
Secure the guide to the wall using a hook to 
ensure stable drainage.	
ln a sink drain pipe
The drain pipe must be above the sink 
siphon so that the end of the hose is at least 
60 cm above the floor.

ln a drain pipe
The drain pipe should be between 60 cm 
and 90 cm high (*). It is advisable to use 
a 65 cm high vertical pipe. Make sure the 
drain hose is connected to the stand pipe at 
a slant.
Drain standpipe requirements:
• 
Minimum diameter of 5 cm
• 
Minimum carry-away capacity of 60 
litres per minute	
STEP 6  Turn on the washing machine
Plug the power cord into a wall socket featuring an AC 220-240 V / 50 Hz approved electrical 
outlet protected by a fuse or circuit breaker. Then, press Power to turn on the washing 
machine.Before you start

6.	 The washing machine is now ready for use.
Laundry guidelines
STEP 1  Sort
Sort the laundry according to these criteria:
• 
Care Label: Sort the laundry into cottons, mixed fibres, synthetics, silks, wools, and rayon.
• 
Colour: Separate whites from colours.
• 
Size: Mixing different-sized items together in the drum improves the washing 
performance.
• 
Sensitivity: Wash delicate items separately using an Easy Iron option for pure, new 
woollen items, curtains, and silk items. Check the labels on the items.
NOTE
Make sure to check the care label on the clothing, and sort them accordingly before starting 
the wash.
STEP 2  Empty pockets
Empty all the pockets of your laundry items
• 
Metal objects such as coins, pins, and buckles on clothing may damage other laundry 
items as well as the drum.

2020/4/2   13:58:02


--- PAGE 25 (TEXT) ---
English  25
Before you start
Turn clothing with buttons and embroideries inside out
• 
If pants or jacket zippers are open while washing, the drum may be damaged. Zippers 
should be closed and fixed with a string.
• 
Clothing with long strings may become entangled with other clothes. Make sure to tie the 
strings before starting the wash.
STEP 3  Use a laundry net
• 
Brassieres (water washable) must be placed in a laundry net. Metal parts of the brassieres 
may break through and tear other laundry items.
• 
Small, light clothing such as socks, gloves, stockings, and handkerchiefs may become 
caught around the door. Place them inside a fine laundry net.
• 
Do not wash the laundry net by itself without other laundry. This may cause abnormal 
vibrations that could move the washing machine and result in injury.
STEP 4  Prewash (if necessary)
Select the Prewash option for the selected course if the laundry is heavily soiled. Do not use 
the Prewash option when detergent is manually added into the drum.
STEP 5  Determine the load capacity
Do not overload the washing machine. Overloading may cause the washing machine to not 
wash properly. For the load capacity for the type of clothing, see page 34.
NOTE
When washing bedding or bedding covers, the wash time may be lengthened or the spin 
efficiency may be reduced. For bedding or bedding covers, the recommended maximum spin 
cycle speed is 800 rpm, and the load capacity is 1.5~2.0 kg or less.
CAUTION
If the laundry is unbalanced and the “UB” information code is displayed, redistribute the load. 
Unbalanced laundry may reduce the spinning performance.
STEP 6  Apply a proper detergent type
The type of detergent depends on the type of fabric (cotton, synthetic, delicate items, wool), 
colour, wash temperature, and degree of soiling. Always use “low suds” laundry detergent, 
which is designed for automatic washing machines.

Before you start
Before you start
NOTE
• 
Follow the detergent manufacturer’s recommendations based on the weight of the 
laundry, the degree of soiling, and the hardness of the water in your local area. If you are 
not sure about the water hardness, contact a local water authority.
• 
Do not use detergent that tends to be hardened or solidified. This detergent may remain 
after the rinse cycle, blocking the drain outlet.
• 
When using powdered detergent it is recommended that the powder should be dissolved 
in warm water to ensure optimum cleaning results.
CAUTION
When washing wool using the wool course, use only a neutral liquid detergent. If used with 
the Wool course, powder detergent may remain on the laundry and discolour the laundry.
Laundry capsules
To get the best results from using laundry capsules, please follow these instructions.
1.	 Put the capsule in the bottom of the 
empty drum towards the rear.
2.	 Put the laundry in the drum on top of 
the capsule.
CAUTION
For cycles using cold water or cycles that complete in less than one hour, the capsule may not 
dissolve completely.

• 
To close the safety knob of the pump 
filter, turn it clockwise. The spring makes 
a rattling sound, which is normal.
NOTE
If the pump filter is clogged, an information code of “5C” appears on the screen.

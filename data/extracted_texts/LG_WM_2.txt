CARING FOR THE ENVIRONMENT
Environmental and Economical Tips
Washer
Energy and water consumption
• Water consumption and energy usage can be affected by the weight 
of the load. To make the best use of your appliance, load the 
maximum amount of dry clothes for the particular programme.
• The most efficient programmes in terms of energy consumption are 
generally those that perform at lower temperatures and longer 
duration.
• Noise and remaining moisture content are influenced by the spinning 
speed: the higher the spinning speed in the spinning phase, the 
higher the noise and the lower the remaining moisture content.
• Evenly loading laundry up to the capacity indicated by the 
manufacturer for the respective programmes will contribute to 
energy and water savings.
• For washing smaller amounts of clothes, the automatic load 
recognition system will help reduce the amount of water and energy 
usage.
• Use the Speed programme for small, lightly soiled loads.
• Cold water laundry detergents can be as effective at lower 
temperatures (about 20 ℃). Using 20 ℃ settings will use less energy 
than 30 ℃ or higher temperatures.

SAFETY INSTRUCTIONS
ENGLISH
Detergent
• Detergent should be chosen according to type, colour, soiling of the 
fabric and the washing temperature. And it should be used according 
to the instruction of the detergent manufacturer. Use only 
detergents that are suitable for Drum (front load) type washers.
• Use less detergent on smaller loads.
- Partial load: 1/2 of the normal amount.
- Minimum load: 1/3 of full load.
Selecting Extra Options and Functions
• Select the water temperature suitable for the type of load you are 
washing. Follow the garment fabric care labels for best results.
• The Pre Wash option is recommended for washing a heavily soiled 
load.
Dryer
Energy consumption
• Spin clothes thoroughly before drying. If the clothes are wet or damp, 
drying time increase therefore the energy consumption increase.
• Load the clothes according to the recommended maximum capacity 
for each drying programme. Overloading is not economical due to 
the increase of energy consumption caused by the increase of drying 
time.
• The installation location should have adequate ventilation to avoid 
pulling in the air from nearby heat sourced appliances. Switch off the 
heat sourced appliances, if possible.
• Clean the lint filter before or after each load. Cleaning the lint filter 
will reduce drying time and energy consumption.

Operation Overview
Using the Washer
Before the first wash, select the Cotton wash 
programme and add a half amount of the 
detergent. Start the appliance without clothes. This 
will remove possible residues and water from the 
drum that may have been left during 
manufacturing.
1
Sort clothes by fabric type, soil level, colour and 
load size as needed.
2
Open the door and load items into the 
appliance.
CAUTION
• Before closing the door, ensure that all clothes 
and items are inside the tub and not 
overhanging on the rubber door seal where they 
will become caught when the door is closed. 
Failing to do so will cause damage to the door 
seal and the clothes.
3
Close the door.
CAUTION
• Remove items from the flexible door seal gasket 
to prevent clothing and door seal damage.
4
Add cleaning products or detergent and 
softener.
• Add the proper amount of detergent to the 
detergent dispenser. If desired, add bleach 
or fabric softener to the appropriate areas of 
the dispenser.
5
Press the Power button to turn on the 
appliance.
6
Choose the desired cycle.
• Press the cycle button repeatedly until the 
desired cycle is selected.
• Now select a wash temperature and spin 
speed. Pay attention to the fabric care label 
of your clothes.
7
Begin cycle.
• Press the Start/Pause button to begin the 
cycle. The appliance will agitate briefly 
without water to measure the weight of the 
load. If the Start/Pause button is not 
pressed within a certain time, the appliance 
will shut off and all settings will be lost.
8
End of cycle.


--- PAGE 28 (TEXT) ---
28
OPERATION-WASHER
• When the cycle is finished, a melody will 
sound. Immediately remove your clothing 
from the appliance to reduce wrinkling.
Preparing the Wash Load
Sorting the Clothes
• For best washing results, sort your clothes 
according to the care label stating fabric type 
and washing temperature. Adjust the spin speed 
or spin intensity in accordance to the fabric type.
• Soil level (Heavy, Normal, Light): Separate 
clothes according to soil level. If possible, do not 
wash heavily soiled items with lightly soiled 
ones.
• Colour (White, Lights, Darks): Wash dark or dyed 
clothes separately from whites or light colours. 
Mixing dyed clothes with light clothes can result 
in dye transfer or discolouration of lighter 
clothes.
• Lint (Lint producers, Collectors): Wash separately 
lint producing fabrics from lint collecting fabrics. 
Lint producers can result in pilling and linting on 
the lint collectors.
Checking the Clothes Care Label
The symbols tell you about the fabric content of 
your garment and how it should be washed.
Symbols on the Care Labels
NOTE
• The dashes under the symbol give you 
information about the type of fabric and the 
maximum allowance of mechanical stress.
Checking the Clothes before 
Loading
• Combine large and small items in a load. Load 
large items first.
• Large items should not be more than half of the 
total wash load. Do not wash single items. This 
may cause an unbalanced load. Add one or two 
similar items.
• Check all pockets to make sure that they are 
empty. Items such as nails, hair clips, matches, 
pens, coins and keys can damage both your 
appliance and clothes.
• Wash delicates (stockings, underwired bras) in a 
wash net.
• Close zippers, hooks and strings to make sure 
that these items do not snag on other clothes.
• Pre-treat dirt and stains by brushing a small 
amount of detergent dissolved water onto stains 
to help lift dirt.

Adding Detergents and 
Softeners
Detergent Dosage
• Detergent should be used according to the 
instruction of the detergent manufacturer and 
selected according to type, colour, soiling of the 
fabric and the washing temperature. Use only 
detergents that are suitable for Drum (front 
load) type washers.
• If too many suds occur, reduce the detergent 
amount.
• If too much detergent is used, too many suds 
can occur and this will result in poor washing 
results or cause heavy load to the motor.
• If you wish to use liquid detergent, follow the 
guidelines provided by the detergent 
manufacturer.
• You can pour liquid detergent directly into the 
main detergent drawer if you are starting the 
wash cycle immediately.
• Do not use liquid detergent if you have selected 
Pre Wash option, as the liquid will dispense 
immediately and may harden in the drawer or 
the tub.
• Detergent usage may need to be adjusted for 
water temperature, water hardness, size and soil 
level of the load. For best results, avoid 
overdosing the detergent. Failing to do so will 
cause oversudsing.
• Refer to the label of the clothes, before adding 
the detergent and choosing the water 
temperature.
• Use only suitable detergents for the respective 
type of clothing:
- Liquid detergent is often designed for special 
applications, e.g. for coloured fabric, wool, 
delicate or dark clothes.
- Powdered detergent is suitable for all types of 
fabric.
- For better washing results of white and pale 
garments, use powdered detergent with 
bleach.
- Detergent is flushed from the dispenser at the 
beginning of the wash cycle.
NOTE
• Do not let the detergent harden. Doing so may 
lead to blockages, poor rinse performance or 
odour.
• Full load: According to manufacturer’s 
recommendation.
• Part load: 1/2 of the normal amount.
• Minimum load: 1/3 of full load.
Using the Dispenser
To add detergent dosage to the dispenser:
1
Open the dispenser drawer.
2
Add the detergent and softener into the 
appropriate compartments.
a Main wash detergent compartment
b Pre-wash detergent compartment
c Liquid fabric softener compartment
d Liquid bleach compartment
3
Gently close the detergent dispenser drawer 
before starting the cycle.
• Slamming the drawer closed may result in 
the detergent overflowing into another 
compartment or dispensing into the drum 
earlier than programmed.
• Be careful not to get a hand caught in the 
drawer while closing.


--- PAGE 30 (TEXT) ---

OPERATION-WASHER
• It is normal for a small amount of water to 
remain in the dispenser compartments at 
the end of the cycle.
Fabric Softener Compartment
This compartment holds liquid fabric softener, 
which is automatically dispensed during the final 
rinse cycle. Either powdered or liquid fabric 
softener may be used.
• Pour fabric softer to the maximum fill line. 
Pouring excessive fabric softener over the 
maximum fill line can cause it to dispense too 
early, which may stain the clothes.
NOTE
• Do not pour fabric softener directly onto the 
clothes in the wash drum, doing so will cause 
dark staining on the clothes that will be difficult 
to remove.
• Do not leave the fabric softener in the detergent 
drawer for more than 1 day. Fabric softener may 
harden. Softener may remain in the dispenser if 
it is too thick. The softener should be diluted if 
the consistency is too thick so that it can flow 
easily.
• Do not open the drawer when water is being 
supplied during the wash.
• Solvents (benzene, etc.) must never be used.
Adding Water Softener
A water softener, such as anti-limescale can be 
used to cut down on the use of detergent in areas 
with high water hardness level.
• First add detergent, and then the water softener. 
Dispense according to the amount specified on 
the packaging.
Adding Detergent Tablets
Detergent tablets can also be used when washing.
1
Open the door and put detergent tablets into 
the drum before loading the clothes.
2
Load the clothes into the drum and close the 
door.
NOTE
• Do not put tablets into the dispenser.

a short period of time if possible to help 
ventilate the drum after use.
WARNING
• For safety reasons, do not allow children or 
animals to enter the appliance. It may cause 
damage or injury.
NOTE
• The final part of a tumble dry cycle occurs 
without heat (cool down cycle) to ensure that the 
clothes are left at a temperature that ensures 
the clothes will not be damaged.
• A high atmospheric temperature and a small 
room may both increase drying time as well as 
energy consumption.
Preparing the Laundry
NOTE
• Do not overload the appliance for the best 
drying performance and most efficient energy 
usage.
Checking the clothes before 
loading
CAUTION
• Check that the clothes are not stuck between 
appliance and door, otherwise the clothes may 
get damaged while drying.
• Observe the maximum load capacity on the 
programme table for the relevant drying 
programme to get optimum drying results. 
Overloading gives a poor drying result and 
causes unnecessary creasing.
• Do not load soaking wet clothes into the 
appliance. It will cause an increasing of drying 
time and energy consumption. Make sure that 
the clothes are spun thoroughly before loading.
• A mixed fabric load can cause the drying time to 
be extended and the time remaining in the 
display to pause during active drying. The 
remaining time will then continue when it is the 
actual time that remains.
• Make sure to empty all pockets. Items such as 
nails, hair clips, matches, pens, coins and keys 
can damage both your appliance and clothes.
• Remove loose belts and close zippers, hooks and 
strings to make sure that these items do not 
snag other clothes.
Sorting the Clothes
Clothes have their own fabric care labels, so drying 
according to the fabric care label is recommended.
Sort the clothes into size and type of fabric and 
then prepare the clothes according to the symbols 
on the fabric care labels.
Woollens
• Be sure to follow fabric care label symbols first. 
Wool may not be completely dried from the 
cycle, so do not repeat drying. Pull woollens to 
their original shape and dry them flat.
Woven and Loopknit Materials
• Some woven and loopknit materials may shrink, 
depending on quality.
Non-Iron and Synthetics
• Do not overload the appliance. Take out non-
Iron items as soon as the appliance stops to 
reduce creases.
Baby Clothes and Night Gowns
• Always check fabric care labels.
Rubber and Plastics
• Do not dry any items made from or containing 
rubber or plastics such as:
- Aprons, Bibs and Chair Covers
- Curtains and Table Clothes
- Bathmats
Fiberglass
• Do not dry fiberglass items in the appliance. 
Glass particles left in the appliance may be 
subsequently picked up by your clothes in later 
cycles.

• Make sure that the power plug is securely plugged into a grounded outlet 
matching the appliance's rating plate.
House fuse is blown, circuit breaker has tripped, or power outage has 
occurred.
• Reset circuit breaker or replace fuse. Do not increase fuse capacity. If the 
problem is a circuit overload, have it corrected by a qualified electrician.
Appliance does not

Water leaks.
The optional drain hose is not connected correctly.
• Connect the optional drain hose correctly.
The door is closed while clothes or foreign substance is caught in the 
door.
• Check if clothes or foreign substance is caught in the door before using the 
appliance. If water leaks continuously, contact the LG Electronics 
Customer Information Centre.
Appliance runs and 
pauses by itself after 
the drying cycle 
finishes.
This is how the anti crease option works.
• Make sure that the anti crease option has been set. The option is designed 
to prevent creases that are formed when the clothes are not unloaded 
promptly after the drying cycle. When the option is set, the appliance runs 
for 10 seconds and pauses for 5 minutes. The option is works for up to 2 
hours.
Symptoms
Possible Cause & Solution
Clothes take too long 
to dry.
Load is not properly sorted.
• Separate heavy items from lightweight items. Larger and heavier items 
take longer to dry. Light items in a load with heavy items can fool the 
sensor because the light items dry faster.
Large load of heavy fabrics.
• Heavy fabrics take longer to dry because they tend to retain more 
moisture. To help reduce and maintain more consistent drying times for 
large and heavy fabrics, separate these items into smaller loads of a 
consistent size.

TROUBLESHOOTING
ENGLISH
Clothes take too long 
to dry.
Appliance controls are not set properly.
• Use the appropriate control settings for the type of load you are drying. 
Some loads may require an adjustment of the dry level setting for proper 
drying.
Lint filter needs to be cleaned.
• Remove the lint from the lint filter after every cycle. With the lint removed, 
hold the lint filter up to a light to see if it is dirty or clogged. With some 
loads that produce high amounts of lint, such as new bath towels, it may 
be necessary to pause the cycle and clean the filter during the cycle.
House fuse is blown, circuit breaker has tripped, or power outage has 
occurred.
• Reset circuit breaker or replace fuse. Do not increase fuse capacity. If the 
problem is a circuit overload, have it corrected by a qualified electrician.
Appliance is overloaded.
• Divide extra large loads into smaller loads for better drying performance 
and efficiency.
Drying time is not 
consistent.
Heat settings, load size, or dampness of clothing is not consistent.
• The drying time for a load will vary depending on the type of heat used 
(electric), the size of the load, the type of fabrics, the wetness of the 
clothes, and lint filter. Even an unbalanced load in the appliance can cause 
poor spinning, resulting in wetter clothes which will take longer to dry.
Greasy or dirty spots 
are left on clothes.
Fabric softener is used incorrectly.
• When washing clothes that are to be dried in the appliance, use the correct 
amount of fabric softener as recommended by the manufacturer of the 
fabric softener.
Clean and dirty clothes are being dried together.
• Use the appliance to dry only clean items. Soil from dirty clothes can 
transfer to the clean clothes in the same or later loads.
Clothes were not properly cleaned or rinsed before being placed in the 
appliance.
• Stains on dried clothes could be stains that were not removed during the 
washing process. Make sure that clothes are being completely cleaned or 
rinsed according to the instructions for your washing machine and 
detergent. Some difficult soils may require pre-treating prior to washing.
Clothes are wrinkled.
Clothes have dried too long (overdried).
• Over drying a load of clothes can lead to wrinkled clothes. Try a shorter 
drying time.
Clothes have been left in the appliance for too long after cycle ends.
• Use the Anti Crease option.

TROUBLESHOOTING
Clothes are shrinking.
Garment care instructions are not being followed.
• To avoid shrinking your clothes, always consult and follow fabric care 
instructions. Some fabrics will naturally shrink when washed. Other fabrics 
can be washed but will shrink when dried in the appliance. Use a low or no 
heat setting.
Lint is left on clothes.
Lint filter has not been cleaned properly.
• Remove the lint from the lint filter after every cycle. With the lint removed, 
hold the lint filter up to a light to see if it is dirty or clogged. If it looks dirty, 
follow the cleaning instructions. With some loads that produce high 
amounts of lint, it may be necessary to clean the lint filter during the cycle.
Clothes have not been sorted properly.
• Some fabrics are lint producers (i.e., a fuzzy white cotton towel) and should 
be dried separately from clothes that are lint trappers (i.e., a pair of black 
linen pants).
Appliance is overloaded.
• Divide extra large loads into smaller loads for drying.
Tissue, paper, etc., has been left in pockets.
• Check pockets thoroughly before drying clothes.
Excess static in clothes 
after drying.
Clothes have dried for too long (overdried).
• Overdrying a load of clothes can cause a buildup of static electricity. Adjust 
settings and use a shorter drying time.
Drying synthetics, permanent press, or synthetic blends.
• These fabrics are naturally more prone to static buildup. Try using fabric 
softener, or use shorter Timed Drying time settings.
Clothes have damp 
spots after a Dry 
programme.
Very large load or very small load. Single large item such as a blanket or 
comforter.
• If items are too tightly packed or too sparse the sensor may have trouble 
reading the dryness level of the load. Use a Timed Drying programme for 
very small loads.
• Large, bulky items such as blankets or comforters can sometimes wrap 
themselves into a tight ball of fabric. The outside layers will dry and 
register on the sensors, while the inner core remains damp. When drying 
a single bulky item, it may help to pause the cycle once or twice and 
rearrange the item to unwrap and expose any damp areas.
• To dry a few remaining damp items from a very large load or a few damp 
spots on a large item after a Dry programme has completed, empty the lint 
filter, then set a Timed Drying programme to finish drying the item(s).

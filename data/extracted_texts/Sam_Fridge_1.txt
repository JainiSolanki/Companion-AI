AND SITE
• When transporting 
and installing the 
appliance,care should be 
taken to ensure that no 
parts of the refrigerating 
circuit are damaged.
• R600a or R134a is used as a 
refrigerant.
Check the compressor label 
on the rear of the appliance 
or the rating label inside the 
refrigerator to see which 
refrigerant is used for your 
refrigerator. 
• When this product contains 
ﬂammable gas (Refrigerant 
R600a),
- Refrigerant leaking from the 
pipe work could ignite or 
cause an eye injury.
If a leak is detected, avoid 
any naked ﬂames or potential

sources of ignition and air the 
room in which the appliance is 
standing for several minutes.
- In order to avoid the creation 
of a ﬂammable gas-air mixture 
if a leak in the refrigerating 
circuit occurs, the size of the 
room in which the appliance 
may be sited depends on the 
amount of refrigerant used.
- Never start up an appliance 
showing any signs of damage. 
If in doubt, consult your 
dealer.
The room where the 
refrigerator will be sited must 
be 1 m³ in size for every 8 g 
of R600a refrigerant inside the 
appliance.
The amount of refrigerant in 
your particular appliance is 
shown on the identiﬁcation 
plate inside the appliance. 
- If the appliance contains 
isobutane refrigerant (R600a), 
a natural gas with high 
environmental compatibility 
that is, however, also 
combustible.
When transporting and 
installing the appliance, care 
should be taken to ensure that 
no parts of the refrigerating 
circuit are damaged.

more than 24 hours, remove 
all frozen food.
• If keys are provided with the 
refrigerator, the keys should 
be kept out of the reach of 
children and not be in the 
vicinity of the appliance.
• The appliance might 
not operate consistently 
(possibility of temperature 
becoming too warm in the 
refrigerator) when sited for an 
extended period of time below 
the cold end of the range of 
temperature for which the 
refrigerating appliance is 
designed.
• Do not store food which spoils 
easily at low temperature, 
such as bananas, melons.
• Your appliance is frost free, 
which means there is no 
need to manually defrost 
your appliance, as this will be 
carried out automatically.
• Temperature rise during 
defrosting can comply with 
ISO requirements. But if you 
want to prevent an undue 
rise in the temperature of the 
frozen food while defrosting 
the appliance, please wrap 
the frozen food up in several 
layers of newspaper.
• Any increase in temperature of 
frozen food during defrosting 
can shorten its storage life.
• The temperature of two 
star section (sections) or 
compartment (compartments) 
which have two star symbol 
(

cool, dry room with adequate 
ventilation.
Ensure that it is not exposed 
to direct sunlight and never 
put it near a direct source of 
heat (radiator, for example).
- Never block any vents or 
grilles on the appliance.
- Allow warm food to cool 
down before placing it in the 
appliance.
- Put frozen food in the 
refrigerator to thaw.
You can then use the low

- Do not keep the door of the 
appliance open for too long 
when putting food in or taking 
food out.
The shorter time for which the 
door is open, the less ice will 
form in the freezer.
- Clean the rear of the 
refrigerator regularly.
Dust increases energy 
consumption.
- Do not set temperature colder 
than necessary.
- Ensure sufﬁcient air exhaust 
at the refrigerator base 
and at the back wall of the 
refrigerator.
Do not cover air vent 
openings.
- Allow clearance to the right, 
left, back and top when 
installing.
This will help reduce power 
consumption and keep your 
energy bills lower.
